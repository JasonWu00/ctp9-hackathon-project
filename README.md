# ctp9-hackathon-project

This is the repository for team "If it works, it works" and their submission to the CTP Cohort 9 hackathon.

### Purpose of the Project

(temporary description)

The purpose of this project is to create a Generative Adverserial Network (GAN) that takes an input image and returns an (for lack of a better word) "animefied" output image, as well as an associated front end website to allow users to make use of the GAN without having to clone this repo and run things on the command line.
