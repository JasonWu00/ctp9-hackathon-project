# ctp9-hackathon-project

This is the repository for team "If it works, it works" and their submission to the CTP Cohort 9 hackathon.

### Dealing with Merge Conflicts

Since merge conflicts where different people push work to the same file might get problematic, I (JasonWu00, owner of this repo) suggest that everyone put their work in [branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) and push their work to the main branch via [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). Yes, this is going to be a hassle, but trying to coordinate every push to github is not a solution either.

Unless everyone manages to coordinate git pushes over Discord, in which case nevermind.

### Purpose of the Project

To be determined.
